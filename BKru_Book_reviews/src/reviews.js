Seeing this from the perspective of a U.S. service member who served during the War on Terror leaves a poignant aftermath, as if the sacrifice for a better Afghanistan for both the Afghani people and U.S. personnel was left just short of realization. Some of the lines, particularly during Miriams closing chapters were some of the best writings I've ever read... 5/5.",

Don't get me wrong, I'm all about French court intrigue but >1000 pages of it, I think not good Sir. All that being said it was satisfying but he didn't quite stick the landing of a truly outstanding novel.",

    text: "This book could have been so much different. By that I mean the author could have subjected the reader to the endless suffering of Post Red October Bolshevik Russia and WWII but instead the reader is treated to the Count and thank God. A light read that at times seems whimsical but will hit you with some of the most profound human observations. Although this isn't my normal reading faire, observing the Count navigate the world (localized within the vibrantly detailed Metropol Hotel) was simply a treat and one that I think many readers will enjoy. Worth the read and although slow at parts, know that it is building towards a satisfying conclusion.",
